# Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only)
Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.

Security: Role based accesses are available according to functional requirements. Such as ADMIN being able to create or modify stories and USERS being able to traverse through a story
Testability: Middleware as well as error testing functions to supplement handling errors that occur within and throughout the building process
